# Aurelia And ES6 Practice Project

Building a clone of the old school game Dope Wars to try out the new framework... Also working in ES6 with Babel for the first time so it's a bit of an adventure.

Project is based off of https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-navigation so I'm getting a lot of things for free which is awesome, but there's also a lot that's probably unnecessary in here.
